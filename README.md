## Devgram

This project was created to test some technologies and software development process. This consists of replicating the Instagram web using the following:

 - NextJS: Framework for creating SRR (server-side rendering) or SSG (static site generation) web apps
 - Tailwind: CSS framework focused on utility classes
 - Firebase: Authentication and storage in real time
 - TDD: Software development process focused on testing first

**This project can also be used as a boilerplate for future web apps that require these frameworks.**

## Getting Started

First setup the firebase credentials in the `.env.local` and `firebase.config` files
